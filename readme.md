# JMake
With the large amount of C++ development I had grown quit adjusted to command-line building, development using atom, and a CMakeLists.txt. I could use netbeans or JGrasp or some other such Java utility but my class projects didn't want there to be packages which NetBeans is a fan of... and I didn't feel like moving files around to make everything work.
So I made this in order to have a similar workflow. I looked at MakeFiles and using a java extension of CMakeLists.txt but ended up just hacking this together overnight. I later decided to polish it up a bit more (add setup.bash generation, package checking, colors) so it could be something neat to have on github.

Fill this out.
